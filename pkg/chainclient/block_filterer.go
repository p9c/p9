// BlockFilterer is used to iteratively scan blocks for a set of addresses of interest. This is done by constructing
// reverse indexes mapping the addresses to a ScopedIndex, which permits the reconstruction of the exact child
// derivation paths that reported matches.
//
// Once initialized, a BlockFilterer can be used to scan any number of blocks until a invocation of `FilterBlock`
// returns true. This allows the reverse indexes to be reused in the event that the set of addresses does not need to be
// altered. After a match is reported, a new BlockFilterer should be initialized with the updated set of addresses that
// include any new keys that are now within our look-ahead.
//
// We track internal and external addresses separately in order to conserve the amount of space occupied in memory.
// Specifically, the account and branch combined contribute only 1-bit of information when using the default scopes used
// by the wallet. Thus we can avoid storing an additional 64-bits per address of interest by not storing the full
// derivation paths, and instead opting to allow the caller to contextually infer the account (DefaultAccount) and
// branch (Internal or External).
