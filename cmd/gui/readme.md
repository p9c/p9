# gui

This is the Parallelcoin Pod wallet GUI, built on a fork of 
[gio](https://gioui.org) and using a customised set of widgets and layouts from 
in the layout, widget and widget/material folders of that repository, where 
several additional widget types have been added, and mostly this is in sync 
with the mainline of the gio repository, though ultimately either they will 
be copying this, or gio will be completely forked as it uses a completely 
different programming idiom that doesn't aim at arbitrary abstract rules 
about composition of the code versus the state, because of the difficulty 
that the pure immediate mode programming model requires. This is because 
that idiom is extremely wordy and long winded and noisy and difficult to 
read, rearrange, and fix.

It has a run control system to launch the individual modules of the 
Parallelcoin Pod, including wallet, blockchain node, a CLI interface to 
these two modules.
