###### A one-sentence pitch about your Project

Open, Programmable, Distributed Business Administration Systems for All

###### What are you planning to achieve with your project?

- To build an application development and deployment system for distributed 
applications that you can access to whatever level of skill, from simple 
scripting and calculation/spreadsheets up to full blown heteregenous, sharded 
virtual shared environments.

- To replace the mess of software repository services and development 
environments with one simple system based on Golang, RPC API and CLI 
scripting, using the Plan 9 from Bell Labs inspired server-oriented, and 
build a set standard libraries to ease the process of learning to develop on the 
platform. On ParallelCoin's network, everyone can build tools and easily share 
them and fork other people's tools without limitation.

###### What is the team size now? Please list each core member of the Project team and outline their role and responsibilities. If any project member is involved in other projects, please clearly state their commitment and how they avoid conflict of interest.

Insert Roadmap Here

###### Where are you right now in your roadmap?

Late Alpha for Plan 9 Hard fork, estimated to be finished beta by July

###### What is the business model of the Project?

To facilitate the development of a community of specialists and promote the 
adoption of our platform as a means to participate in the decentralised economy.

ParallelCoin's planned application development environment is not just for 
on-line services but includes web but focusing on 

###### What is the potential user base and market opportunity?

We are aiming to gain adoption especially by small and medium businesses, 
assisting them to integrate crypto payments and administration systems into 
their existing setup.

### Token Information & Economics

###### Token Name and Symbol

ParallelCoin - DUO

###### What is the primary use case of your token?

On-chain service fees for Oracle state update transactions, payments for 
users of chain-connected market and exchange services and payments in general.

###### Where else can your token be used?

###### What is the total supply of your token?

Currently at around 220,000, with at least 170,000 known to be out of 
circulation either permanently or for some time to come (from exchange hacks). 

The upcoming Plan 9 Hard Fork will recalibrate the chain to emit a total of 
1,000,000 tokens and a minor fork planned later upgrades to 256 bit token 
denomination precision to account for the small supply.

###### What is the circulating supply of your token?

Approximately 240,000 DUO

###### Please provide a breakdown of current token allocation.

Tokens have never been allocated on this chain, only mined. An issue of 
funds to remunerate the developers and team members and fund the team is 
planned to take effect upon the Hard Fork

###### Please provide a list of team wallets that hold your token.

Currently only the legacy wallet [https://github.com/p9c/p9/releases/tag/1.
2.0](https://github.com/p9c/p9/releases/tag/1.2.0)

###### Please provide all lockups in place for any holders of the token.

We are currently in the process of learning about options for building the 
bridge for the token, it is pretty much standard bitcoin JSONRPC2 and so it 
should not be complicated to do it, as is the script engine still identical 
to bitcoin.

###### Are you compliant in all jurisdictions that you service and operate in?

We are not engaging in any fiat gateway services and have currently no 
formal investment vehicle, and there is no securitization in our protocol 
and none is planned, though such may be part of future projects building on 
the development environment we are planning for after the fork.

###### Is the token currently running on any network other than Binance Chain?

none at all

###### Please provide explorer links to each version of the token.

[https://oldex.parallelcoin.info/](https://oldex.parallelcoin.info/)

###### Please provide a detailed token migration plan. What mechanism will you be using?

We intend to have a bridge server that a user can load with their stock of 
DUO tokens, add further by deposit, and at the will of the owners of these 
tokens, lock them using scripts to enable issuance on the Dex, like how the 
Bitcoin Binance Bridge works, using the SDK and based on an existing, proven 
bridge system.

###### What is the exact timeline of opening the swap/bridge to the public? Will you be able to complete this prior to the end of the voting period? If yes, please provide evidence that it the swap/bridge is ready or close to being ready.

At this point we don't even know where to find the starting point to 
building a bridge as the Binance Bridge has no source code released and 
other than ethereum bridges we have not yet found anything that can do this. 
The binance documentation is unhelpful in this also.

###### ~~If your tokens currently still sit in only 1-5 addresses, please provide the timing of when they will be fully allocated to users.~~~

N/A: tokens are only mined, none to date issued under special consensus 
conditions.

###### Is the token currently listed on any other exchange? What are they?

[https://dex-trade.com](https://dex-trade.com) - however this is an 
untrusted exchange with dubious credentials that we are warning our users to 
not use.

### Funds

###### Did you conduct an ICO or any type of fundraising? When was it?

Never, never will, though there will be an issuance upon hard fork 
activation to remunerate developers and provide a base fund for promoting 
the project.

~~How much in total did you raise?~~
~~How much have you spent in total thus far? What have you spent these funds 
on?~~

###### How much runway does your project require to ship the final product?

The hard fork has already over 2.5 years of work wrapped up in it and should 
be less than 3 months to release. See the timeline above for information 
about the development platform project time estimates

###### What currency/coin/token do you plan to hold your funds in?

Primarily Bitcoin and other major well known tokens, we don't have a formal 
structure, each team member is managing their own capitalisation at this point.

###### What’s your coin storage/conversion policy? Do you only convert to fiat when you spend?

We are HODLers... fiat is only for running expenses because the supermarket 
hasn't adopted our not-yet-existing business administration system.

###### How do you plan to publish your spending each month? 

The bridge will have automatic and IPFS-mirrored storage of the ledger of 
locks, unlocks, cross-chain migrations. If this question relates to the 
spending of investment funds, we have no public investment so there is 
nothing to report.

###### Where are your funds stored? Please provide the addresses for public community tracking.

We have no formalised structure yet and are waiting on clues how to make our 
Bridge and that will be where the funds are managed and 

###### ~~~If you have plans to conduct an IDO, please provide a detailed plan including IDO format, methodology, timeline, fundraising goal and amount of tokens, and sale price.~~~

### Development

###### What are the technological innovations of the project, if there are any?

We are building a distributed application development environment targeted 
at all levels of skill, from rudimentary scripts like in spreadsheets, to 
simple logic like shell scripting and seamlessly merged with pure Go code, 
upon which we will be building systems to implement and distribute and 
secure the data for various Oracles and other databases like for managing 
inventory in production lines, distribution and logistics. All businesses of 
over about 10 employees has someone who can write simple logic to make 
custom tools for a business. We want to put tools in their hands that make 
decentralised networks as easy as Excel, Word and Access.

###### Where are your code repositories located?

[https://github.com/p9c](https://github.com/p9c)

The two most important repositories are [matrjoska](https://github.com/p9c/matrjoska)
and [pod](https://github.com/p9c/p9). The former is where current work is 
going on while there is a lot of changes in API and restructure/refactoring, 
the latter is where the full release will live.

###### Do you have any products or UI demos can you share publicly? Are any built by your community, as opposed to being in-house demos?

We have one initial prototype of the planned construction industry 
administration system, a calculator that allows a user to inventory all of 
the materials and services required for a construction project, and 
generating all of the necessary documentation required to submit to planning 
authorities. Our team member Cedomir will be managing the curation of the 
Oracles that we will build with his knowledge in the field in the region we 
intend to deploy first (Serbia).

##### Do you plan to release weekly progress updates in this forum?

We are in late stages of finishing a complete suite of web sites amongst 
which will be reports and blogs from the team, if it is simple to link the 
API we could push the relevant ones to this forum so we don't have 
complicated manual work required to propagate the updates.

##### Do you plan to host monthly or bi-monthly video AMAs?

Once we have dealt with current ongoing issues with securing sufficient 
working capital and the hard fork is completed we will need to promote both 
what we are doing and helping users with building stuff on our platform.

### Competitors

###### Who do you view as your current competitors/peers?

As we see it, right now, nobody is building a distributed business 
administration system framework. There is centralised services, and there is 
specialised, narrow niches such as smart contract development, but we want 
to build the tools for everything from the GUI through middleware, deploying 
new sidechains and oracles, chat and messaging systems including 
collaborative work spaces (like MindMeister and Google Docs). 

So, in short, we don't have competitors right now, in the crypto space, and 
we are bringing ideas that have proven themselves from the centralised 
software development companies like Google and Microsoft, and putting them 
on decentralised systems so they are more secure and resilient.

###### What is your project’s competitive advantage over existing or potential future solutions?

The main advantage is that the users can change our systems as much as they 
like, to exactly suit their own business, which also creates an opportunity 
for people that develop knowledge and skills in using it to become 
contractors providing such services.
